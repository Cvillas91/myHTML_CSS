Homework Assignment #2: Images

Part 1: Write the HTML
    It's time to make your recipe (from homework #1) a little more exciting.
    1. Add a title to your page (within the <head>) and an actual <h1> title on the page.
    2. Below the h1, add a paragraph that explains what the food is, and why you like it so much.
    3. Somewhere on the page, add a few images of finished versions of your dish so that the reader can see what the 
    final product should look like.
    4. Add emojis to your second list (the ordered list), so that at least 5 of the lines end with an emoji character. 
    You can find emojis online pretty easily. If you don't how to use emojis in HTML, read this article. Then use this reference.


Part 2: Save the HTML
    Once you have created your document, save the file as a ".html" file. 
    For example, the name of the file could be "recipe.html" or "homework1.html" etc.

    <h1>Pasta with Tuna and Capers in White Wine Sauce Recipe</h1> <!--The h1 tag for the recipe's name-->
    <p>This is a pasta served with a sauce made with oil-packed canned tuna, onions, capers, white wine, and parsley,
        it is one of my favorites because there is a little secret within this recipe: olive oil-packed canned tuna, chili pepper flakes, 
        and pasta is a master combination (and classic Italian).

                Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt (1 1/2 teaspoons for every quart of water), return to a boil. 
                Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until cooked through, but still firm (al dente).&#x1F345
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook the onions and chili pepper flakes: While the water is coming to a boil and the pasta is cooking, prepare the rest of the recipe. 
                In a large, wide saut√© pan, heat a couple tablespoons of olive oil on medium heat. Add the chopped onion and chili pepper flakes and cook 
                until translucent, about 5 minutes or so. &#x1F343
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix in the canned tuna, the capers, and the salt. Add the wine, bring to a simmer then lower the heat to low. 
                Cook for 10 minutes or longer, while the pasta is cooking. If the mixture begins to dry out, add a little more wine. &#x23F2
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the drained pasta to the tuna mixture: When the pasta is ready, drain it and add it in to the pan with the tuna. 
                Toss to mix. &#x1F44C
            </li>
            <li>
                Drizzle on a bit more olive oil over it all, then add the chopped parsley and a few grinds of black pepper to taste. &#x1F35D
