Project #1

Part 1: Write the HTML
    We didn't cover all the possible HTML tags yet. What are they? And what should they be used for?
    For this project you should:
        1. Find a resource online that gives you a list of each HTML tag that you can use.
        2. Pick 5 of those tags (5 that we have not covered so far).
        3. Create a simple website about your favorite book / story, and include those 5 tags in the HTML. 
        (The page can have any other tags as well, as long as those 5 are included). This can take any form. 
        You can get as complicated or as simple as you wish.
        4. Add comments to each section of your code, explaining the purpose of that block.

For extra credit, use one or more of these tags (if you haven't already):
    1. <video>
    2. <audio>
    3. <form>
    4. <select>
    5. <input>
    6. <base>
    7. <meta>
    8. <iframe>

Part 3: Share Your Work and Teach Others [REQUIRED]
    It's time to share your work with the world, and teach others what you learned. 
    Write up a short explanation (1-2 paragraphs) of the code you created. Explain what you learned in the course so far, 
    and then explain how your code works.
    Then, take your explanation and create a post online that shares your code and the writeup. This could be any of the options below:
    Pick one of these options only
        1. A blog post / Medium post
        2. A reddit post
        3. A tweet
        4. An instagram post or story
        5. A facebook post or story
        6. A LinkedIn post
        7. A youtube video / screenshare
        8. A facebook video / screenshare
        9. A Snapchat or Tiktok video
    Pick the option that works for you. Get creative! Once you're done, take screenshots of the post/video you created.
    Note: Creating a post in our Student Forum does not count, as the purpose of the assignment is to teach the public, not our current students.

    It was Sonia’s birthday. She had a new game. <small>‘Dinosaur Dig!’</small> said Sonia. <br><br>
    <small>‘Fantastic! This is just what I wanted!’</small><br><br>
    Sonia decided to try her new game. She switched on the computer, put the game in and looked at the screen. <br><br>
    A strange icon appeared. Sonia clicked on the icon. FLASH! <br><br>
    <small>‘Where am I?’</small> said Sonia. <br><br>
    <strong>‘You’re in Dinosaur Dig,’</strong> said the boy next to her. <br><br>
    <strong>‘We have to find old dinosaur bones.’ </strong><br><br>
    <small>‘Here’s one!’</small> said Sonia. She picked up a golden bone that was hidden under a bush. <br><br>
    <strong>‘No!’</strong> shouted the boy. <br><br>
    <strong>‘You mustn’t pick the golden ones up! Now watch out for the dinosaur!’</strong><br><br>
    Suddenly they heard a noise behind them. The ground began to shake. They heard a dinosaur roar.<br><br>
    <strong>‘RUN!’</strong><br><br>
    Sonia and the boy ran fast through the bushes, but the dinosaur was getting closer. Sonia and the boy hid behind a bush. <br><br>
    <small>‘What will happen if the dinosaur catches us?’</small> asked Sonia. <br><br>
    <strong>‘Well, the game is over! But I’ve got three lives left. How many have you got?’</strong> <br><br>
    <small>‘Only one!’</small><br><br>
    ‘ROAR!’ The dinosaur was there! <br><br>
    <small>‘Look!’</small> shouted Sonia. There was the same icon that she saw on her computer. Sonia touched the icon. FLASH! <br><br>
    Sonia was at home, sitting at her computer. She looked at the game. <br><br>
    <small>‘Bye, bye, dino,’</small> she said. <br><br>
    <small>‘Hmmm. Maybe I’ll play a different game.’</small> <br><br>
