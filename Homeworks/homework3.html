    <h1>Pasta with Tuna and Capers in White Wine Sauce Recipe</h1> <!--The h1 tag for the recipe's name-->
    <p>This is a pasta served with a sauce made with oil-packed canned tuna, onions, capers, white wine, and parsley,
        it is one of my favorites because there is a little secret within this recipe: olive oil-packed canned tuna, chili pepper flakes, 
        and pasta is a master combination (and classic Italian).

                Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt (1 1/2 teaspoons for every quart of water), return to a boil. 
                Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until cooked through, but still firm (al dente).&#x1F345
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook the onions and chili pepper flakes: While the water is coming to a boil and the pasta is cooking, prepare the rest of the recipe. 
                In a large, wide saut√© pan, heat a couple tablespoons of olive oil on medium heat. Add the chopped onion and chili pepper flakes and cook 
                until translucent, about 5 minutes or so. &#x1F343
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix in the canned tuna, the capers, and the salt. Add the wine, bring to a simmer then lower the heat to low. 
                Cook for 10 minutes or longer, while the pasta is cooking. If the mixture begins to dry out, add a little more wine. &#x23F2
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the drained pasta to the tuna mixture: When the pasta is ready, drain it and add it in to the pan with the tuna. 
                Toss to mix. &#x1F44C
            </li>
            <li>
                Drizzle on a bit more olive oil over it all, then add the chopped parsley and a few grinds of black pepper to taste. &#x1F35D
            </li>
