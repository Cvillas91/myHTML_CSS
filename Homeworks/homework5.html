Homework Assignment #5: Classes and IDs

Part 1: Write the Code
    1. Refactor (aka rewrite / reorganize) your code from assignment #4 so that more than 75% of your CSS is selecting elements by classes and IDs.
    2. Give your ordered list and unordered list unique classes.
    3. If you haven't yet, find a resource online that explains all the different CSS properties you can use in your website.
    4. Change the bullet-points in the unordered list so that they are an image/icon of your choosing.
    5. Change the numbers in the ordered list so that they are roman numerals instead.
    6. Within one of your paragraphs, add <span> elements around several words or phrases that should be emphasized.
    7. Within your CSS create a selector that will only apply to <span> elements that are within <p> elements, and make them italic.
    8. Within your CSS create a selector that will only apply the last <span> within a <p> tag, and make it underlined.
    9. Give the first <span> element within the <p> tag a special class. Now add CSS that will remove the italics and apply a red color instead.

                Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt (1 1/2 teaspoons for every quart of water), return to a boil. 
                Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until cooked through, but still firm (al dente).&#x1F345
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook the onions and chili pepper flakes: While the water is coming to a boil and the pasta is cooking, prepare the rest of the recipe. 
                In a large, wide saut√© pan, heat a couple tablespoons of olive oil on medium heat. Add the chopped onion and chili pepper flakes and cook 
                until translucent, about 5 minutes or so. &#x1F343
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix in the canned tuna, the capers, and the salt. Add the wine, bring to a simmer then lower the heat to low. 
                Cook for 10 minutes or longer, while the pasta is cooking. If the mixture begins to dry out, add a little more wine. &#x23F2
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the drained pasta to the tuna mixture: When the pasta is ready, drain it and add it in to the pan with the tuna. 
                Toss to mix. &#x1F44C
            </li>
            <li>
                Drizzle on a bit more olive oil over it all, then add the chopped parsley and a few grinds of black pepper to taste. &#x1F35D
