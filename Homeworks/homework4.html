Homework Assignment #4: Basic Styling

Part 1: Write the Code
    Let's go back to your recipe (from assignments #1, #2, and #3), and add some styling to it. 
    You can choose to use inline styles, or a <style> block within your document, or an external stylesheet. It's up to you. 
    If you use an external stylesheet make sure to include it in the files you upload.
    1. Change the background color of the entire page (choose any color you wish)
    2. Change the font size of the paragraphs and lists so they are different sizes.
    3. Add padding below each heading (h1, h2 etc) you've used, to space them out from the content they're above.
    4. Make the page title (the h1) bold, and make it underlined.
    5. Find a website that lists out all the various css properties you can use, and note that URL as a comment in your code.
    6. Using that website as a resource, add a styling property that we haven't covered yet.

    <h1>Pasta with Tuna and Capers in White Wine Sauce Recipe</h1> <!--The h1 tag for the recipe's name-->
    <p>This is a pasta served with a sauce made with oil-packed canned tuna, onions, capers, white wine, and parsley,
        it is one of my favorites because there is a little secret within this recipe: olive oil-packed canned tuna, chili pepper flakes, 
        and pasta is a master combination (and classic Italian).

            <li>
                Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt (1 1/2 teaspoons for every quart of water), return to a boil. 
                Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until cooked through, but still firm (al dente).&#x1F345
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook the onions and chili pepper flakes: While the water is coming to a boil and the pasta is cooking, prepare the rest of the recipe. 
                In a large, wide saut√© pan, heat a couple tablespoons of olive oil on medium heat. Add the chopped onion and chili pepper flakes and cook 
                until translucent, about 5 minutes or so. &#x1F343
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix in the canned tuna, the capers, and the salt. Add the wine, bring to a simmer then lower the heat to low. 
                Cook for 10 minutes or longer, while the pasta is cooking. If the mixture begins to dry out, add a little more wine. &#x23F2
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the drained pasta to the tuna mixture: When the pasta is ready, drain it and add it in to the pan with the tuna. 
                Toss to mix. &#x1F44C
            </li>
            <li>
                Drizzle on a bit more olive oil over it all, then add the chopped parsley and a few grinds of black pepper to taste. &#x1F35D
            </li>
