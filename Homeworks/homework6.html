Homework Assignment #6: Responsiveness

Part 1: Write the Code
    It's time to make your recipe a bit more mobile friendly.
    1. Using a combination of HTML and CSS changes, modify your recipe site so that it works well on mobile devices of all sizes.
    2. Within your browser's dev-tools, simulate different screen sizes so that you can check your work.
    3. Look up the css "media" rule, and learn how to apply special styles to different browser sizes.
    4. Using one media rule, target all browsers smaller than 400px
    5. Using another media rule, target all browsers between 401px and 750px;
    6. Using another media rule, target all browsers larger than 750px.
    7. Add special styles to each media screen to enhance responsiveness (adjust font sizes, colors, hide and show content, etc).

                    Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt (1 1/2 teaspoons for every quart of water), return to a boil. 
                    Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until cooked through, but still firm (al dente).&#x1F345
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cook the onions and chili pepper flakes: While the water is coming to a boil and the pasta is cooking, prepare the rest of the recipe. 
                    In a large, wide saut√© pan, heat a couple tablespoons of olive oil on medium heat. Add the chopped onion and chili pepper flakes and cook 
                    until translucent, about 5 minutes or so. &#x1F343
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mix in the canned tuna, the capers, and the salt. Add the wine, bring to a simmer then lower the heat to low. 
                    Cook for 10 minutes or longer, while the pasta is cooking. If the mixture begins to dry out, add a little more wine. &#x23F2
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the drained pasta to the tuna mixture: When the pasta is ready, drain it and add it in to the pan with the tuna. 
                    Toss to mix. &#x1F44C
                </li>
                <li>
                    Drizzle on a bit more olive oil over it all, then add the chopped parsley and a few grinds of black pepper to taste. &#x1F35D
