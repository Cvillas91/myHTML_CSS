Homework Assignment #1: Lists

Part 1: Write the HTML
    What's your favorite food? Do you know how to make it yourself? 
    If not, look up the recipe online. Next, create an HTML document, and within the body of the page, create two lists:
    1. The first list should be an unordered list of all the ingredients needed to make the dish.
    2. The second list should be an ordered list, detailing the steps you need to take to prepare that dish.
    Then, add comments to your HTML, to explain the purpose of each section of code that you create.

Part 2: Save the HTML
    Once you have created your document, save the file as a ".html" file. 
    For example, the name of the file could be "recipe.html" or "homework1.html" etc.

                Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt (1 1/2 teaspoons for every quart of water), return to a boil. 
                Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until cooked through, but still firm (al dente).
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook the onions and chili pepper flakes: While the water is coming to a boil and the pasta is cooking, prepare the rest of the recipe. 
                In a large, wide saut√© pan, heat a couple tablespoons of olive oil on medium heat. Add the chopped onion and chili pepper flakes and cook 
                until translucent, about 5 minutes or so.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix in the canned tuna, the capers, and the salt. Add the wine, bring to a simmer then lower the heat to low. 
                Cook for 10 minutes or longer, while the pasta is cooking. If the mixture begins to dry out, add a little more wine.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the drained pasta to the tuna mixture: When the pasta is ready, drain it and add it in to the pan with the tuna. 
                Toss to mix.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drizzle on a bit more olive oil over it all, then add the chopped parsley and a few grinds of black pepper to taste.
            </li>
